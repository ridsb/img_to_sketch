# Image Sketch Generator

This Python script takes an input image, converts it into a sketch, and displays both the original and the sketch images using the OpenCV library.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`pip install opencv-python`)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the script.

2. Ensure you have a compatible image file (e.g., `image.jpg`) in the same folder as the script.

3. Run the script:

    ```bash
    python sketch_generator.py
    ```

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to enter the name of the image file (including the file extension, e.g., `image.jpg`).

5. The script will display the original image and the generated sketch image.

## Notes

- Make sure the image file is in the same folder as the script.
- The generated sketch image is saved as `sketch.jpeg` in the script's folder.
